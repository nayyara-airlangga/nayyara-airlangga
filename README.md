# Hi! Nice to meet you

You can call me Angga. My field of work is in tech and occasionally product. I specialize mainly in back end and infrastructure engineering but I can do full stack if needed. I've also done a few projects related to AI, specifically in NLP.

I like to learn and get better each day. I also like to share my knowledge so I write about my stories and experiences in this [blog](https://nairlangga.com) of mine.

You can contact me through these platforms:
